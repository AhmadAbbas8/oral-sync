This graduation project presents a transformative mobile application designed to forge a symbiotic relationship between dental college students and financially disadvantaged patients, facilitating essential dental examinations.

The **OralSync** mobile application harnesses the ubiquitous nature of smartphones to create a dynamic platform. Here, dental college students can provide much-needed services to patients unable to afford traditional dental clinic costs. The application features intuitive user interfaces for seamless registration, match finding, appointment scheduling, and secure health information exchange.
